title: From blogspot to github.io
---
My [blogspot blog](https://rogierwessel.blogspot.nl) has been dead for years, not good! There wasn't much to `blah` about, also writing something technical on blogspot with nice formating like...

```type=json
{
  "id": "/pentaho/biserver/biserver.1.2",
  "cpus": 0.25,
  "mem": 1024.0,
  "instances": 1,
  "container": {
    "type": "DOCKER",
    "docker": {
      "image": "pentaho/biserver:1.2",
      "network": "BRIDGE",
      "portMappings": [{
        "containerPort": 8080,
        "hostPort": 0,
        "servicePort": 0,
        "protocol": "tcp"
      }]
    }
  },
  "healthChecks": [
   {
     "protocol": "HTTP",
     "path": "/_status",
     "portIndex": 0,
     "gracePeriodSeconds": 200,
     "intervalSeconds": 10,
     "timeoutSeconds": 5,
     "maxConsecutiveFailures": 3
   }
 ]
}
```

... makes you wanna shoot yourself and burry that blog far far away.

# Enter git, github pages, jekkyl, markdown and some pretty theme ...
