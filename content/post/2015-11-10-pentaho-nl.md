Last weekend the European Pentaho User meetup [#pcm15](https://github.com/PentahoCommunityMeetup2015/info/blob/master/README.md) was held in London. Two days of hacking, technical talks and beer was the perfect recipe to make a great meeting.

We had great talks, and I caught up with some Dutch colleagues and we concluded there should be some local NL followup to this community initiative!

So here it is, a [Pentaho NL Usergroup](http://www.meetup.com/Pentaho-NL-Meetup/), and it
would not be a meetup if there wasn't any [tweettweet](https://twitter.com/PentahoNl)...

Soon we'll set out a first date, but please register on meetup!

Regards, Rogier
