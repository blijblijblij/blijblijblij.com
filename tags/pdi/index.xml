It has (irc supported) chat, voice calls, proper code snippet sharing but it really shines in its ability to integrate all that is important to a team.
For example we integrate:
updates on github, Pull requests, comments, &amp;hellip; updates on tickets, new, open, closed tickets updates from ci, builds, tests, the occasional #FAIL updates from deploys instantiated from ci onto the mesos cluster updates on failing services and network components from nagios bash scripts synchronising in the background or via cron One thing was missing Updates from pesky long running etl-jobs, while being away from the vpn-ed carte status page.</description></item></channel></rss>
